\lettercontent{Dear McLaren Racing Team,}

\lettercontent{
   I am thrilled to express my interest in an internship opportunity with McLaren Racing. As a highly motivated engineering student with a passion for high-performance motorsport, I am excited about the chance to contribute to your team while continuing to develop my skills in an environment that embodies engineering excellence and innovation.
}

\lettercontent{ 
    My journey began with competitive programming and math Olympiads, where I gained a solid foundation in problem-solving and algorithmic thinking, skills that have been instrumental in my university studies. This foundation has fueled my drive for engineering innovation, and I have since honed my programming abilities by completing over 200 problems on Codeforces, all available on my GitHub.
}

\lettercontent{
    Throughout my experiences, I have grown to appreciate the power of teamwork and adaptability, essential qualities in the high-stakes world of motorsport. At Science4Tech, I applied these skills by contributing to machine learning models that optimized clinical trials in oncology, dealing with complex data to improve efficiency. Most recently, as a Data Engineer at Esperanto Technologies, Inc., I designed and validated ONNX graphs for Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, driving substantial gains in processing efficiency.
    My ongoing project—a full-stack web application born from a hackathon win—has also deepened my experience in both front- and back-end development.
}

\lettercontent{ 
    I am inspired by McLaren Racing’s relentless pursuit of excellence and commitment to pushing boundaries. I am confident that my technical skills, combined with my passion for innovation, would make me a valuable addition to your team. Please find my resume attached for further details. I am available for an interview at your convenience and can be reached at +34 660813180 or via email at delossantospol001@gmail.com.
